## How to Play

Make sure Flash is installed, as you'll need it to play most of our games. You can install it [here](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/). (NOTE: Clicking the link in Chrome will ask you to run Flash. If you really want to install it, press Yes, then click [here](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/) again, but Chrome already has Flash included, so this shouldn't matter until 2020. By that time, we will have hopefully converted our Flash games to HTML5 so that this isn't required anymore.) Then, run the games. Voila!

If you're on iOS, try the [Puffin Web Browser](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/puffin-web-browser-free/id472937654?mt=8). It's easy to use and supports Flash, so you can run all of our games!
